# RGB-HEX Converter
## CodeCademy Project

In this project, I used Bitwise operators to build a calculator that can convert RGB values to Hexadecimal (hex) values, and vice-versa.

There are three methods in the project:

- A method to convert RGB to Hex
- A method to convert Hex to RGB
- A method that starts the prompt cycle

The program does the following:

Prompts the user for the type of conversion they want
Asks the user to input the RGB or Hex value
Uses Bitwise operators and shifting in order to convert the value
Prints the converted value to the user
